## Description

Duration: Weekend Project

This calculator was built to track the monthly cost of employee salaries based on input from fields in a form. The form included employee first and last name, ID number, employee title, and annual salary. A table would be generated to track this employee data and each line could be deleted with a delete button which would update the running monthly cost total displayed at the bottom of the screen. Functionality was also included to trigger a visual color change if this monthly cost total exceeded a budget cap.

## Built With

Visual Studio Code
JQuery
GitHub
